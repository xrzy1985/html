  <body>

    <center>This element will center anything inside of the element.
      Anything inside of the center tag will be centered relative to
      the parent element. So, if an element is at the top right, and
      inside of a center tag. Then, the text in the center tag will be
      centered inside of the element in the top right.
    </center>

    <br />

    <em>

      The em element is a tag specifically for italic text

    </em>

    <br />

    <i>, but the i element will do the very same thing. I would imagine
      that i was created just to shorten the time, but who knows.
    </i>
